6-Docker Compose for multicontainer apps

- I frickin' love every logo for the Docker services. They're so cute and nautical themed I wanna flip.

- compose the polling app in an attahced state

- check out the app and ctrl c when done

- go through all the parts of the .yml file

- talk about how it creates its own network

- look at the source code and talk about referencing the containers by name rather than ip

- look at the things it made with docker images and docker ps -a

- bring it up again in a detached state

- see that it reuses everything, does not rebuild the images

- bring it down and see that it gets rid of the containers but not the images, but you can use the --rmi option to remove the images (docker-compose stop to stop the composed app, you probably have to be in the directory of the .yml file?)

-  talk about using the -v and --rmi opptions with compose down

- the next time you bring it up it will not build the images again unless you use the build flag 

- talk about persisting data with volumes

- talk about removing volumes and volume ls, this should maybe go in another module, removing volumes with the container https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes OR CAN YOU JUST USE DOCKER VOLUME PRUNE
