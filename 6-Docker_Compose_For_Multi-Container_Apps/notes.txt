6-Docker Compose for multicontainer apps

- I frickin' love every logo for the Docker services. They're so cute and nautical themed I wanna flip.

- compose the polling app in an attahced state

- check out the app and ctrl c when done

- go through all the parts of the .yml file

- look at the source code and talk about referencing the containers by name rather than ip

- look at the things it made with docker images and docker ps -a

- bring it up again in a detached state

- see that it reuses everything, does not rebuild the images

- bring it down and see that it gets rid of the containers but not the images

- the next time you bring it up it will not build the images again unless you use the build flag 

- talk about persisting data with volumes
