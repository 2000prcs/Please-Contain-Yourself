6-Docker Compose for multicontainer apps

x I frickin' love every logo for the Docker services. They're so cute and nautical themed I wanna flip.

x compose the polling app in an attahced state

x check out the app 

- go through all the parts of the .yml file 

- ASIDE: about the start up order and it is a good idea to make your archetecture robust enough to handle network hiccups without crashing

- ctrl c when done

- talk about how it creates its own network

- look at the source code and talk about referencing the containers by name rather than ip (can it be whatever name?? YES!) you dont know what the containers address is going to be so the connection urls support automatic service discovery

- look at the things it made with docker images and docker ps -a

- bring it up again in a detached state

- see that it reuses everything, does not rebuild the images

- bring it down and see that it gets rid of the containers but not the images, but you can use the --rmi option to remove the images (docker-compose stop to stop the composed app, you probably have to be in the directory of the .yml file?)

-  talk about using the -v and --rmi opptions with compose down

- the next time you bring it up it will not build the images again unless you use the build flag 

- talk about persisting data with volumes

- talk about removing volumes and volume ls, this should maybe go in another module, removing volumes with the container https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes OR CAN YOU JUST USE DOCKER VOLUME PRUNE
