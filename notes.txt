1-Installation:
- disclaimer: mac users you should be familiar with working in the teminal, git/version control, servers/ports, ect. add more as the come up 
- Download docker https://www.docker.com/products/docker
- check docker version commands
- docker info
- hello world container
- explain the warning and where the image came from
- explain what a dockerflie, image, and container is and the differences
- show the docker images on your machine
- show all the containers on your machine, talk about how hello world is a short lived container
- spin up a buunch of hello world containers, show that they went through their lifecycle by showing the containers again 
- talk about how names are randomly assigned but well see how to assign names later
- show that htere is still inly one image
- show how to remove images locally?

2-Bundle_Your_App
- build an image using the helloServer+random number without first starting it
- explain the layering some more
- spin up one with a name tag take, see it running in the teminal, visit it in browser, note of its random number
- explain how to stop it and restart it (access it with its name tag)
- spin up another one and show that the random number is different
- talk about lifecycle and statelessnes
- dont remove it, we'll be using it a bit later

- explain how to destroy the containers, show that they are destoyed in teminal\
- build an image with an already going server
- restart it and show that it will be the same random number each time
- explain how all pointers are preserves in the image 

- spin up a bunch of hello servers, all on different ports
- visit all these ports and show that they are all different random numbers
- show this effect on "docker info"
- take them all down
- point out that that was a bit of a pain, Docker has tools to make managing lots of containers like we just did a piece of cake

3-Containerized Development with Volumes
- what is a volume
- why is this useful
- bundle it into an image once youre happy with it
- push it to dockerhub (all that setup jazz), talk about how it has version control for images
- remove the image from your computer
- pull it down from dockerhub and run it

- will I need to expand on volumes
- do you use volumes to share date between containers or nah?
