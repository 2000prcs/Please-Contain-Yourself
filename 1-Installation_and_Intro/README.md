#### A note about the symantec formanting in this tutorial:

Text that looks `like this --for --example` are commands that you should type into your terminal. Or else.

**Bold text: Gotchas that are gonna getcha if you don't heed this advice**

## With that out of the way, lets get started!


First things first, lets install Docker:

- [ ] Go to [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) and download the version that's appropriare for your operating system

- [ ] After you've dragged Docker into your Applications, find Docker in your applications and click it to complete the installation

- [ ] Check to make sure everything worked correctly. Open up the terminal and type `docker --version`

You should see something like:
```sh
Docker version 1.13.0, build 49bf474
```
as long as its NOT:
```sh
-bash: Docker: command not found
```
if it looks like that then something went wrong with the download or installation. Oops.

- [ ] Nice! Let's run your first Docker command! in the terminal type `docker info`

You should see something like this: 
![dockerinfo](https://github.com/dylanlrrb/P-C-Y-Assets/blob/master/1/dockerinfo.png.png?raw=true)

"This command displays system wide information regarding the Docker installation. Information displayed includes the kernel version, number of containers and images, and memory allocated to running containers. The number of images shown is the number of unique images. The same image tagged under different names is counted only once." --Docker Docs

This should make a little more sense as we go along, we'll be revisitigthis command to see how our actions affect this report.
