#### A note about the symantec formanting in this tutorial:

Text that looks `like this --for --example` are commands that you should type into your terminal. Or else.

**Bold text: Gotchas that are gonna getcha if you don't heed this advice**

## With that out of the way, lets get started!


First things first, lets install Docker:

- [ ] Go to [Docker's website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) and download the version that's appropriare for your operating system
- [ ] After you've dragged Docker into your Applications, find Docker in there and click it to complete the installation
- [ ] Check to make sure everything worked correctly. Open up the terminal and type `docker --version`
You should see something like:
```sh
Docker version 1.13.0, build 49bf474
```
as long as its NOT:
```sh
-bash: Docker: command not found
```
if it's that then something went wrong with the download or installation. Oops.
