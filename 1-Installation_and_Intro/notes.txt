hello world container
explain the warning, explain to wait and where the image came from
- let them know that if they dont see the succesful pulldown message that something went wrong and to try again
explain what a dockerflie, image, and container is and the differences (use sandwich analogy, Dockerfile is a recipie, image is a sandwich made from the recipie that you dont dare eat becaure its so perfect, so preserve in the refidgerator forever- if you ever want that sandwich, you put it in your sandwich cloning machine so you can spin up and eat as many of that sandwich as you want based on and without messing with your perfect mother sandwich in the refirdgerator.)
docker info again
show the docker images on your machine
show all the containers on your machine, use docker ps and show that you need to use ps -a, talk about how hello world is a short lived container
spin up a bunch of hello world containers, show that they went through their lifecycle by showing the containers again 
talk about how names are randomly assigned but well see how to assign names later
give one a name with --name punk_unicorns, show it with ps -a
show that there is still only one image
