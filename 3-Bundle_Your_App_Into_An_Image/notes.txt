3-Bundle_Your_App




- BUILD an image using the helloServer+random number without first starting it


- spin up one with a name tag tag, see it running in the teminal, visit it in browser, take note of its random number
- explain how to stop it and restart it (access it with its name tag) AND map to a port
- spin up another one and show that the random number is different
- talk about lifecycle and statelessnes
- dont remove it, we'll be using it a bit later


- spin up a bunch of (pure) hello servers, all mapped to different ports
- visit all these ports and show that they are all different random numbers
- show this effect on "docker info"
- take them all down
- point out that that was a bit of a pain, Docker has tools to make managing lots of containers like we just did a piece of cake



what a docker file actually is
you can find all sorts of prebuilt images to build on at docker hub

**To set up your environment configuration correctly with a Dockerfile, you will need to follow the instructions provided with the base image you are building on top of. The configuration of the layers below may require your Dockerfile to follow specific steps**


How to bundle an app into a container image
What a Dockerfile is
Several  Dockerfile commands
Containers are stateless

docker history <image-name>
docker build   <image-name>
` -t` flag
