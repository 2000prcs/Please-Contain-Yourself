# Module 3 - Bundle Your App into an Image

#### A note about the symantec formatting in this tutorial:

- [ ] Check boxes are steps that need to be completed.

Text that looks `like this --for --example` are commands that you should type into your terminal. Or else.

---
>Asides: Side notes to ponder while staring off into the distance.

**Bold text: Gotchas that are gonna getcha if you don't heed this advice**

**Click on an image if you need a larger view**

## With that out of the way, let's get started!


- [ ] If You have not already cloned this repo onto your computer, do so now. You will be making use of files in the repo during this module

- [ ] `cd` into the repo and then `cd` into the directory '/3-Bundle_Your_App_Into_An_Image'

>If you havent already guessed this repo comes with a little app that we're going to containerize with Docker. The app uses node.js and express to create a server that assigns itself a random number and then serves that random number to whoever asks for it.
>
>You don't have to, but if you want to see this app in action before you containerize it, you will have to have node and npm installed on your machine. From inside the '/3-Bundle_Your_App_Into_An_Image' directory, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.
>
>Visiting `localhost:3000` in your browser will serve the message:
```sh
Hello! This server's random number is: <randomNumber>
```
>
>Notice that even if you keep refreshing the page, it will continue to serve the same random number. The number is assigned when the server is started up and persists as long as it is running. Restarting the app, hoverver, will cause it to reassign and serve a different random number. This feature of our app is important for demonstration purpuses.
