5-Make multiple containers work together
- will I need to expand on volumes
- may need to talk about the fact that --link is depreciated
- do you use volumes to share date between containers or nah?
- 
- looks like containers will be able to communicate if connected to the same network
- do they just need to be listening to ports? on which? the container of the host?
- make sure it does work when on the same network but that it doesnt when they are on different networks
- containers connected to two networks can link networks

- a asking server that saves responses to a database and asks if you want to submit another response
- a mongodb? database that saves the responses (how to work in the command line of inside the container)
- a telling server that asks for, formats, and serves a view of the form responses


-Should I talk about using volumes to persist data outside the container here?

ONE KIND OF IMAGE PER CONTAINER (not a bunch shoved into one, that would make a big unwieldy image/container), FORCES US TO THINK IN MICROSERVICES, BREAKS UP MONOLITHIC APPLICATIONS
