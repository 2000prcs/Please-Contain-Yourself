So. You've heard about this cool thing called Docker. 

And suddenly everyone is talking about it, and everyone is using it, and oh-my-gosh what do you mean you're not using it, and do you live in the stone age or something, and you're freaking out because it makes no sense, and you're scouring github for any helpful information about it as you weep and scarf down ice cream and it's dripping on your keyboard and making it all sticky.

No? Just me?

Well, I made this repo as a resource for developers ~~just like me~~ just like YOU, who know that Docker is a powerful tool but have no idea where to start.

It is designed to take you from just knowing "Docker" as a buzzword to utilizing Docker as a really useful tool in development, deployment, and scaling.

>Disclaimer. Sort of.

>To go through this tutorial you should be comfortable with topics that include, but are not limited to: working in the terminal, git/ version control, servers and ports.

>The time commitment for this tutorial from start to finish  is about 3 hours. Feel free to tackle it in chunks. I do not, however, suggest jumping around the tutorial, the modules build off each other and you're gonna have a bad time if you jump around. 

>This tutorial is given from the perspective of a Mac user. We will be working in the terminal A LOT so there might be some quirky little differences in the terminal commands and installation. It might take a little more effort on a Window user's part to find functional equivalents to the steps laid out.
