Module 2

spin up a nginx webserver "docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginx", 
show that ps shows running ones with details, 
go to local host and check it out
but its also on ps -a with a status of 'RUNNING'

explain what the other flags do with an annotated? screeshot

(without the -d flag it shows logging but you cant escape without ctrl+C, once you exit tho, you can restart it and it behaves normally)
-d === run in a detached state; which means just run the container in the background without entering into it
- try it out without -d

you can use this nginx server without actually having nginx installed on your computer! this is what I mean when I say that containers do not rely on outside dependencies to run; everything is bundled into your image and running it will aways create the same independent container, all while reamining very lightweight

docker stop webserver, not in ps any more but can find it in ps -a
you can restart it by going docker start with either the name or the container id (same goes with stopping)
- if you want to remove a stopped container, docker rm <container-name>
- if you want to remove a running container without stopping it first use docker rm -f <>
still have both images locally (show that with docker images), if you needed to remove them you would go:
docker rmi <image-name>
THIS WILL FAIL because there are still containers that reference the immage even though they are stopped
remove all the hello world containers that have reached the end of thier lifecycle and stopped by docker rm <container-name> <container-name> <container-name>
try to remove the hello world image again. check thats its gone with docker images
that being said, if you dont want to clean up after yourself you can just go docker rmi -f <image-name> but you should really clean up after yourself, no one else is going to keep your computer clean.
you can run an image with the --rm flag like so, docker run -d -p 80:80 --rm --name goodbye nginx
see that its running with docker ps
stop it
look for it with docker ps -a, Its nowhere to be   
finally, remove the nginx image
DONE
