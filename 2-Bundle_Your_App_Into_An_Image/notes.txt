2-Bundle_Your_App
- BUILD an image using the helloServer+random number without first starting it
- explain the layering and the setup of the dockerfile some more
- spin up one with a name tag tag, see it running in the teminal, visit it in browser, take note of its random number
- explain how to stop it and restart it (access it with its name tag) AND map to a port
- spin up another one and show that the random number is different
- talk about lifecycle and statelessnes
- dont remove it, we'll be using it a bit later

- explain how to destroy the containers, show that they are destoyed in teminal?
(unless you already want the previous one running to build an image from it)
- BUILD an image with an already going server
- restart it and show that it will be the same random number each time
- explain how all pointers are preserves in the image 
- then maybe talk about destroying containers and show it on docker info

- spin up a bunch of (pure) hello servers, all mapped to different ports
- visit all these ports and show that they are all different random numbers
- show this effect on "docker info"
- take them all down
- point out that that was a bit of a pain, Docker has tools to make managing lots of containers like we just did a piece of cake
